## About The Project

The purpose of this project was to create a working framework of a mobile responsive portfolio. This framework was created using three HTML files with styling primarily constructed using Bootstrap (v4.5.2). My primary focus was creating a responsive page layout three different breakpoints (i.e., 992px, 768px, and 400px). This portolio is no where near finsihed, but a good starting point to house my projects.
